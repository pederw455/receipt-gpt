### Cheesy Apple Omelette

#### Ingredients
- 2 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
- 20 dl milk
- 4 eggs
- 200 grams cheese, grated (ost)

#### Instructions

**1. Prepare the Apples**
   - Slice the apples into thin pieces for an even cook.
   - Set aside.

**2. Beat the Eggs**
   - Crack the 4 eggs into a bowl.
   - Add 20 ml (2 dl) of milk.
   - Whisk together until well combined.

**3. Cook the Apples**
   - In a non-stick frying pan, cook the sliced apples over medium heat until they are slightly soft.

**4. Add the Egg Mixture**
   - Pour the egg and milk mixture over the apples in the pan.
   - Cook on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the eggs begin to set but are still slightly runny on top.

**5. Add the Cheese**
   - Sprinkle the 200 grams of grated cheese evenly over the egg mixture.
   - Cover the pan with a lid to help the cheese melt evenly and the top of the omelette to cook.

**6. Serve the Omelette**
   - Once the cheese is fully melted and the eggs are cooked through, remove from heat.
   - Slice the omelette into two portions and serve hot.
