    While you donâ€™t need to use all the available ingredients, try to incorporate as many as possible. 
    If additional ingredients or more of the existing ones are needed, include them in a "Shopping Cart" section formatted as:
    - [amount] [unit] - [ingredient]

    The recipe should include:
    1. A clear and descriptive title.
    2. A detailed list of ingredients, including quantities and measurements.
    3. Step-by-step preparation instructions:
    - Each step should be clearly numbered.
    - Include optional tips or variations where relevant.
    4. A "Shopping Cart" section listing any missing or additional ingredients required in this format:
    - [amount] [unit] - [ingredient]

    Ensure the recipe is easy to follow, realistic for the specified servings, and includes precise ingredient quantities. 
    If adjustments are necessary for the servings, add those ingredients to the shopping cart. Provide practical and authentic suggestions.
