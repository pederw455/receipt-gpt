I'm sorry, but it looks like the ingredients you have may not be sufficient to create a recognizable breakfast dish for 8 servings. However, I can suggest a simple dish using the ingredients you do have, in case you can obtain the additional ingredients:

### French Toast (Insufficient Ingredients)

#### Ingredients
- 4 eggs (you have enough)
- 20 dl milk (sufficient, but ensure you have enough for soaking the bread)

Currently missing or insufficient ingredients:
- **Bread**: Typically, you would need about 16 slices of bread for 8 servings of French toast.
- **Butter**: For frying
- **Syrup or powdered sugar**: For serving
- **Cinnamon or vanilla extract** (optional): For added flavor

#### Preparation Steps

1. **Prepare the Mixture**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until fully combined.
   - Optionally, add a dash of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla extract for extra flavor.

2. **Soak the Bread**
   - Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, ensuring both sides are fully coated. Let the bread soak for a few seconds to absorb the mixture.

3. **Cook the Toast**
   - Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add a small amount of butter.
   - Place the soaked bread slices into the pan and cook until golden brown on both sides.

4. **Serve**
   - Serve the French toast with syrup or powdered sugar.
   - Optionally, you can add fresh apple slices or other fruits on top for added flavor.

### Alternative Suggestions:
- **Omelet or Scrambled Eggs:** With the available eggs, milk, and apples, you can create creative omelets or scrambled eggs, possibly including apples as a unique twist. You would still need additional ingredients for 8 servings.
- **Smoothies:** Utilize the milk and apples in a smoothie if additional fruits or a supplement like yogurt is available.

Unfortunately, without the required bread and additional ingredients, it's challenging to create a typical breakfast recipe for 8 servings with what is currently available. Consider acquiring the missing ingredients for a full dish.
