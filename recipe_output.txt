**Title: Cheese and Chicken Breakfast Sandwich**

**Ingredients:**

1. Cheese - 50 grams
2. Egg - 1 piece
3. Salt - a pinch
4. Chicken - 200 grams (you may want to use only part of this)
5. Bread - 4 pieces (you will use 3 for the sandwiches)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preparation of Chicken:**
   - Cut the chicken into thin slices or small pieces.
   - Season the chicken slices with a pinch of salt and pepper (from available seasonings).
   - In a pan, add a little oil and heat it over medium heat.
   - Cook the chicken slices until they are golden brown and fully cooked, approximately 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

2. **Preparing the Egg:**
   - Break the egg into a bowl, adding a pinch of salt and any preferred seasoning.
   - Beat the egg until the yolk and whites are well combined.
   - In a frying pan, add a little oil and pour in the beaten egg to make a simple omelette.
   - Cook on medium heat for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the egg is set. Remove and set aside.

3. **Assembling the Sandwich:**
   - Lightly toast the bread pieces in a toaster or in a pan.
   - For each of the 3 sandwiches, lay down one piece of toasted bread.
   - Add a layer of cooked chicken slices on top of each bread piece.
   - Cut the cooked omelette into three portions, and place one portion on top of the chicken in each sandwich.
   - Grate or slice the cheese and evenly distribute it over the omelette on each sandwich.
   - Top each sandwich with a second piece of toasted bread.

4. **Melting the Cheese:**
   - If needed, place the assembled sandwiches back in the pan over low heat, cover, and let the cheese melt. This should take only a couple of minutes.
   - Serve hot and enjoy!
